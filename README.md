TwitterArchiveBreakdown
=======================

An explanation of your Twitter activity. The idea started as I hit 3000 tweets and wanted to see a breakdown of all the things I'd done.

I'm fully aware that this basically already exists, as http://twitter.leermakers.net/, but I think I can do some things better, like attaching numbers and percentages to things.
